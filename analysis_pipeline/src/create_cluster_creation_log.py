'''
The purpose of this file is to convert my old experimental information into the new format
required by the updated interface. The old system had an ad-hoc assemble of config files saved
from the kubectl daemon, while the new system uses a centralized cluster_creation_log that
gives information about the creation/destruction of on-cluster entities
