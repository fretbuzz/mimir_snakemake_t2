## Mimir
Mimir is an experimental apparatus designed to test the potential for anomaly-based data exfiltration detection in microservice-architecture applications. It creates a graphical representation of network communication and flags deviations from structural invariants.

Be advised that the project is still pre-alpha and does not do everything that you'd want it to.


## Running Analysis Pipeline
The analysis pipeline takes pcap files and generates a trained model for detecting anomalies on further traffic from that applicaton. Currently, it ONLY generates the model (using the training set) and gives results on the validation set, at the various hyperparameter options. It WILL also be able to apply this trained model to a testing/eval set SOON, but it doesn't do that YET (should be working by ~4/15).

This analysis pipeline been tested on MacOS and Linux 16.04. It will not work on Windows.

### Step 1: Prerequisites
First, install non-python-related dependencies. 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) is needed because the system uses the MulVal container. 
* [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/getting.html) is needed if you want to compare to [directional eigenvector method](http://ide-research.net/papers/2004_KDD_Ide_p140.pdf). 
* [Tshark \& editcap](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterBuildInstall.html) are used to parse the pcap. 
* [Pdfkit](https://github.com/pdfkit/pdfkit/wiki/Installing-WKHTMLTOPDF) is used to generate reports, which at the current stage is the best way to evaluate performance.

Then install the python-related dependencies.

* Make sure [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) are installed.

* Make sure pip is up-to-date:
```
pip install pip
```

* Then install the necessary python packages:
```
pip install docker networkx matplotlib jinja2 pdfkit numpy pandas seaborn Cython pyyaml multiprocessing scipy pdfkit
```

### Step 2: Set configuration file
In the analysis_pipeline/analysis_json/ directory, can modify the file sockshop_one_v2_minimal.json 
This is a simple configuration file that the system uses. If running for the first time, only need to modify a couple lines:

* cur_experiment_name: name of this instance of the analysis pipeline (can be different than the name of the experimental data)
* "exp_config_file": this is the path of the json configuration file generated by the experimental coordinator. Ends in '_analysis.json'
* "netsec_policy": path of the file specifying the network security policy (or none)

Various parts of the pipeline can be skipped to speed up processing. These can be found in "Analysis Pipeline configuration parameters" in the wiki.

### Step 3: Starting the system
Move to the analysis_pipeline/ directory. The system can be started via:
```
python mimir.py --training_config_json analysis_json/sockshop_one_v2_minimal.json
```

The system will LATER be also able to take an evaluation configuration file, to give online alerts. But it CANNOT do that right now. But it WILL be able to do that SOON (by ~4/15).

### Step 4: Examining the Output
\[TODO\]
